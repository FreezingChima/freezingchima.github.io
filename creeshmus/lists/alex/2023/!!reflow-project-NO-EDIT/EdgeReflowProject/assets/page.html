            This year, I have decided to repeat what I did last year and construct a webpage where you can find the Christmas presents I wish to recieve this year listed out and easily accessible. Below I have embedded a workbook created in Microsoft Office Excel, which you can use to access the links to obtain the presents. Have fun&#x21;
